# Retail-Stock-Trading-PnL-Analytics-Yahoo-Finance
📊 Retail Stock Trading & PnL Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail stock trading performance using historical market data from multiple publicly listed Indian companies across different industry sectors. The objective is to evaluate portfolio profitability, identify top- and underperforming stocks and sectors, and assess investment risk using metrics such as daily returns, profit and loss (PnL), and volatility.

The analysis combines SQL-based analytics with an interactive Power BI dashboard to transform raw stock price data into actionable insights for performance monitoring and decision support.

🎯 Business Objectives

Analyze overall portfolio performance over time

Identify top-performing and loss-making stocks

Evaluate sector-wise contribution to total PnL

Assess risk and volatility at stock level

Enable interactive analysis using filters (year, sector, stock)

🧹 Data Preparation & Processing

The raw data was cleaned and transformed using Python and SQL:

Removed duplicate and invalid records

Standardized stock symbols and sector names

Calculated daily returns using closing prices

Structured the data using a star schema:

dim_date

dim_stock

fact_stock_prices

This structure supports scalable analytics and efficient querying.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python – Data collection and cleaning

SQL (MySQL) – Data modeling and analytics

Power BI – Data visualization and dashboarding

GitHub – Version control and project documentation
